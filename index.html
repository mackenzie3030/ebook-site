					<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>The old saying still rings true… you are what you eat. The foods you eat are broken down to become a part of you. This is why food quality is so important.</p>

					<h3>Training</h3>
					<p>Your body is made to move. Exercising and lifting weights is what allows your body to function properly over the years. It is also what gives you the physique you want.</p>

    			<h2>Get your Nutrition Locked Down</h2>
				<p>Nutrition should be your number one priority. Diet alone can have the most profound effect on your body and mind.</p>
				<p>Think your diet is already pretty good?</p>
				<p>What if I told you I could make it even better. I guarantee you will feel better than you have in years!</p>
				<p>Stop looking to others to make your decisions. Learn to forge your own path in life and discover things for yourself. ONLY YOU can determine what is right for you. And only you can decide to make a change and transform your life.</p>
				<p>This is your chance to start eating with purpose. Everything you need to transform your life through food, is in this e-book.</p>
